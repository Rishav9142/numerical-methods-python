This repository contains Python implementations of basic numerical methods in linear algebra.

## Programs

- **cholesky.py** — Performs Cholesky decomposition to find the lower triangular matrix `L` such that `A = L × Lᵀ`.
- **gaussian_elimination.py** — Converts an augmented matrix to its **Row Echelon Form (REF)** using Gaussian Elimination.
- **gram_schmidt.py** — Implements the **Gram–Schmidt Orthogonalization** process on a 3×3 matrix to obtain orthogonal and orthonormal bases.

## How to Run

Run any file using:
```bash
python filename.py
